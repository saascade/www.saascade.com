                Screenshots or logs that show our software misbehaving are particularly welcome in this regard. 
                If we can't fix things and you're still unhappy, then we're happy to issue a refund.

              <p>

              <p>
                Please evaluate our software thoroughly first for a shorter period (like at least a year) before committing permanently.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note that purchases older than 60 days cannot be refunded.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note that life-time purchases are generally not refundable either, as it's just too complicated for us to prevent misuse.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lost licence keys cannot be recovered/refunded, so please backup your licences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please do not share your licence keys, because we'll have no choice but to ban them - meaning your software will stop working.
              </p>
              <p>
                To prevent misuse, lost/stolen licence keys also cannot be reissued or unbanned. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Please choose our shorter term licences to limit your exposure to potential loss in case of hard drive failures or hacked email accounts etc.

                The system stays responsive in the face of failure. This applies not only to highly-available, mission-critical systems — any system that is not resilient will be unresponsive after a failure. Resilience is achieved by replication, containment, isolation and delegation. Failures are contained within each component, isolating components from each other and thereby ensuring that parts of the system can fail and recover without compromising the system as a whole.

                The system stays responsive under varying workload. Reactive Systems can react to changes in the input rate by increasing or decreasing the resources allocated to service these inputs. This implies designs that have no contention points or central bottlenecks, resulting in the ability to shard or replicate components and distribute inputs among them. Reactive Systems support predictive, as well as Reactive, scaling algorithms by providing relevant live performance measures.

                Reactive Systems rely on asynchronous message-passing to establish a boundary between components that ensures loose coupling, isolation and location transparency. Employing explicit message-passing enables load management, elasticity, and flow control by shaping and monitoring the message queues in the system. Location transparent messaging as a means of communication makes it possible for the management of failure to work with the same constructs and semantics across a cluster or within a single host.
